## 1. Hypotheses 
The Null hypotheses and the alternative hypothesis have been formulated well. Great Job! 


Gokmen wanted to check if the subscribers are more likely to take shorter trips than customers.

For the question raised, the Null hypothesis was set as:
*The ratio of subscribers taking trips longer than the overall average of trip length, over subscribers taking shorter trips (that is, less than average trip length) is the same or higher than the ratio of customers taking trips longer than the overall average of trip length duration over customers taking shorter trips (that is, less than average trip length)*

The sigfnificance level was mentioned after the null hypothesis and alternative hypotheis. It could have been part of the hypothesis statement. But good job mentioning the significance level!


## 2. Data
The data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question. The trip duration and user type variables are part of the data. Good Job picking a question that can be answered using the data!

Two needed variables is the trip duration and date.
Gokmen has extracted these two columns correctly and dropped all the irrelevant variables.
Then, he classified each trip duration as long or short as compared to the overall average trip duration. This allowed him to plot the ratio of short to long trips for both subscribers and customers. I felt it is a smart way to classify the duration as short and long!

## 3. Test
To test H0 given the type of data and the question asked, I prefer to choose the t test or the Z test.

Below is the reasoning for choosing t-test or the z-test
I follow the chart presented in the lecture slides. The following is the path 
1. Do samples come from same or different populations
2. Assume the data is parametric
3. Number of categories is 2
4. Data is not paired
5. if we assume variance is same, then we use Z-test else we use Welch t test.
