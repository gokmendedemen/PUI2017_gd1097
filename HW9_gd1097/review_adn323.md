The plot is easy to understand. However, I think fontsizes are too small, making it difficult to read. For the figure on the left, I would prefer to define the x axis as million ZAR (assuming the currency in Capetown is ZAR), so that one can write 1 instead of 1000000 and so on, which facilitates understanding the figure, making it less crowded. In addition, there is a line fitted to the data, but we are not sure which model is used (OLS, WLS etc.). A legend can be added to the plot showing which model was used to fit the black line, so that the plot will be more informative. Finally, I think the plot honestly reproduces the data.
