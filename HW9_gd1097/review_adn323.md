**In terms of clarity**, the plot is easy to understand, overall. However, I think fontsizes are too small, making it difficult to read xticks and yticks labels as well as the title. For the figure on the left, I would prefer to define the x axis as million ZAR (assuming the currency in Capetown is ZAR), so that one can write 1 instead of 1000000 and so on, which facilitates understanding the x axis values, making it more clear. In addition, there is a line fitted to the data, but we are not sure which model is used (OLS, WLS etc.). A legend can be added to the plot showing which model was used to fit the black line, so that the plot will be more informative and clear. **In terms of esthetics**, the graphical choices (scatter plot and fitted line) are appropriate. Finally, **in terms of honesty**, I think the plot honestly reproduces the data, providing necessary insights (water consumption increases when property value increases).
