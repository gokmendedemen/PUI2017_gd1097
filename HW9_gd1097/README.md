Part 2 : GeoSpatial Analysis of LinkNYC

Team Composition : Michael M Sampson (mms911), Gokmen Dedemen (gokmen), Bianca Brusco (bb1569)

In this assignment we get Census data to see the percentage of households with broadband access, and the geographic distribution of the linkNYC around the city. 
I was mostly in an observant position, Bianca did most of the work. 
We used the function written by Professor Bianco (choropleth.py) for some of the plots.
