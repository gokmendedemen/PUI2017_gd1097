PUI2017 HW 11

Team Composition : Michael M Sampson (mms911), Gokmen Dedemen (gd1097), Bianca Brusco (bb1569)

Assignment 1: Clustering time series.

In this assignment we use census data between 1993 and 2014, looking at number of business establishment by zip code for each year. We then use K-mean clustering to create groups zip codes with similar trends, in terms of number establishment throughout the years., and visualize the different clusters on a map as a choropleth. We compare the results with a the ones from a different clustering algorithm : in my case, I used hierarchical clustering.

I mainly did this assignment on my own, but compared results with Bianca's work.

Assignment 2 : K-mean clustering algorithm and visualization.

In this assignment, we write our own K-mean clustering algorithm, and then visualize its process through an animation. 
I worked on this in class during Lab time and then finished individually. We compared our results.
